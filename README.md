## 🎯 Inspiration

As students, one of our biggest challenges was navigating **course and professor selection**. While the catalog gives an outline, it doesn’t answer questions like:

- "Is this course actually worth taking?"
- "Which professor should I pick?"
- "Is this professor a tough grader?"

**Mason Critique** solves this by crowdsourcing honest, anonymous feedback — built by students, for students.



## 🚀 What We Built

### ✅ Core Features
- 📝 Anonymous & named reviews for **courses** and **professors**
- ⭐ 5-star rating system + tough grader indicators
- 📈 GPA calculator & course tracker via user dashboard
- 🔎 Smart search and filters by course level (100–400+)
- 📊 Visualized grade distribution charts
- 🧬 Auto-fill course details from GMU CS catalog




## ⚙️ How We Built It

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase Firestore, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - Chart.js (grade visualizations)
