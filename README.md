## 🎯 Inspiration

As students, one of our biggest challenges was navigating **course and professor selection**. While the catalog gives an outline, it doesn’t answer questions like:

- "Is this course actually worth taking?"
- "Which professor should I pick?"
- "Is this professor a tough grader?"

**Mason Critique** solves this by crowdsourcing honest, anonymous feedback — built by students, for students.
